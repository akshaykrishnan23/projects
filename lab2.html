		<p> <b>Delhi : Royal Enfield Hunter 350, the newest motorcycle from the iconic bike maker brand is all set to be launched in India today. The new bike will be launched in India as one of the most affordable bikes of the manufacturer while keeping the basic features intact. It is to be noted that details of the new bike have leaked earlier, and the launch event is expected to reveal the variant-wise pricing of the new bike. With this new bike lingering in between a neo-retro tourer and scrambler, the brand is hoping to create its position in a relatively budget-friendly space. </b></p><br>

	<h1 style="color: red;" ><u>Royal Enfield Hunter 350: Design </u></h1>
		<p><i>The new Royal Enfield Hunter 350 has a distinct body shape that leans more toward the brand's sportier side than its touring DNA, although sharing the same 350 cc engine as the Bullet and Classic. The bike's round headlamps, indicators, and long single-piece seat also have a vintage vibe to it. The bike appears to be smaller than the company's earlier motorcycles.</i></p><br>
	<h1 >Royal Enfield Hunter 350:Features</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>A split double-cradle frame will accommodate the 2022 Royal Enfield Bullet 350, and it might also have a few additional features.</li>
		<li> The updated bike is projected to include features like the Tripper navigation pod, which is an option, and semi-digital instrumentation akin to what is found on current-generation RE bikes.</li>
		<li>In addition to upgraded switchgear and an electric starter as standard are also available.</li>
	</ol>	
	<h1>Royal Enfield Hunter 350:Price</h1>
		<p>The new Royal Enfield Hunter 350 is anticipated to have a price tag with greater numbers on it given the recently added features and modifications. The Bullet 350 is currently  	the	least expensive RE at Rs 1.47 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi), but the lower end of that price range is occupied by less expensive kick-start-only varieties, which the new       	J-platform machine will not offer. Prices for the new bike should therefore be in the vicinity of Rs 1.5 lakh.</p>

	<h1>Royal Enfield Hunter 350 vs Royal Enfield Classic 350: Engine specs, Dimensions,Etc compared</h1>
		<p>Royal Enfield’s latest Hunter 350 is the brand’s new entry-level motorcycle in the line-up. With a starting ex-showroom price (Chennai) of ₹1.49 lakh, the base Hunter 350 Retro 	variant undercuts the single-channel ABS version of the Classic 350 that starts from ₹1.90 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi).</p>
		<p>Both the motorcycles are based on the J-series platform, which means both get the 350 cc engine with counter balancer shafts. Brakes are the same, along with suspension units 		as well. However, the differences are more than just what meets the eye</p>
		<p>For starters, the Hunter 350 is the lightest motorcycle in Royal Enfield’s portfolio. With 181 kg of kerb weight, the Hunter 350 Metro variant is almost 10 kg lighter than the	 	Classic 350. The base Retro variant, on the other hand, weighs 177 kg.
			Coupled with that less weight, the roadster also boasts of a compact design. The rake angle has been reworked and it is now 1 degree sharper than the Classic 350s, which helps bring down its trail down to 96.4 mm, compared to the Classic’s 111.7mm. The wheelbase alson shortens up and at 1370mm, the Hunter 350’s wheelbase is 20 mm shorter than the Classic 350s.</p>
		<p>The Hunter 350 also boasts several new design elements, like the exhaust pipe and side panels are completely new units. The small circular instrument cluster on the base Retro 		variant is also new, but the one available in top-spec variants along with the tripper navigation are shared units also seen in the Scram 411 bike.</p>

		<p>Both the Hunter and Classic 350 are built on the same twin downtube spine frame. But the subframe on the roadster has been redesigned to accommodate the single-piece seat. The  	Classic 350 gets a split seat design. Suspension set up is the same in both the motorcycles - 41 mm telescopic front forks with 130 mm of wheel travel, while the rear get    		 twin tube Emulsion shock absorbers with 6-step pre-load.</p>
